# Talkatoo Translator

The goal of this project is to create a tool for recognizing and translating the list of moons mentioned by Talkatoo. To achieve this we plan to use OCR to detect the moons given by Talkatoo, mapping them to the desired output language and displaying them in a custom user interface.
This would allow you to do runs of Talkatoo% in any language you want and could be a pretty big timesave over English.
